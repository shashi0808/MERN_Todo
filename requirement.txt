Objective:
Build a simple yet well-structured To-Do application using the MERN stack. The frontend must be built with Next.js. This assignment is meant to test your ability to design clean APIs, handle CRUD operations, and deploy a full-stack project.
Requirements:
•	Tech Stack:
•	Frontend: Next.js (React framework)
•	Backend: Node.js + Express
•	Database: MongoDB (Atlas preferred)
•	Features:
•	Create a new task (title, description, status – e.g., pending/done).
•	Read tasks (display all tasks in a list).
•	Update task details (edit title, description, or status).
•	Delete a task.
•	Tasks should persist in the database (not just frontend state).
•	Additional (Bonus Points):
•	Implement user authentication (sign up / login).
•	Add filtering/sorting of tasks (e.g., show only completed tasks).
•	Use server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js for better SEO.
•	Responsive UI with clean design.
Deliverables:
•	GitHub Repository containing:
•	 Clean code with proper commits.
•	 A README.md explaining:
•	 Project setup instructions.
•	 Tech stack used.
•	 Any assumptions or bonus features implemented.

Evaluation Criteria:
•	Code quality & project structure.
•	Functionality (CRUD operations must work end-to-end).
•	UI/UX design & responsiveness.
•	Deployment readiness (works on given link).
•	Bonus features (if implemented).
